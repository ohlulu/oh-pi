# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 2026.03.08-1

### Extensions

- Updated `ralph-wiggum` — moved state storage from `.ralph/` to `.pi/ralph/`; added checklist guard: `ralph_done` now issues a soft warning when the checklist count is unchanged since the previous iteration, prompting the agent to update the task file before advancing (second consecutive call without progress passes through automatically); strengthened prompt templates with mandatory task-file update instructions and clearer consequence notes.

### Skills

- Updated `sdd` — renamed "Design" phase to "Plan" (`design.md` → `plan.md`, `design-guide.md` → `plan-guide.md`); added Chinese trigger words; added approval gate presentation note (explain each phase in plain Chinese before user approves); added Handoff to doc-system section (INDEX.md entry + milestone `_index.md` link after Tasks approval); expanded Spec Evolution section with explicit edit-in-place vs. delta workflow decision tree; added Small Change and Large Change (delta) sub-workflows; strengthened anti-patterns and quality gates.
- Updated `doc-system` — added decision table for when to create a separate milestone file vs. index-row-only entry; added anti-pattern for duplicate checklists (milestone file with checklist when `tasks.md` already exists).
- Updated `ralph-wiggum` — updated file path references from `.ralph/` to `.pi/ralph/`.

### Config

- Updated `AGENTS.md` — added Skills section: agents must scan `<available_skills>` descriptions on turn 1 before reading any project file; strengthened root-cause mandate (articulate root cause in 1–2 sentences before writing any fix); relaxed commit-as-you-go wording to crossing-module-boundary heuristic.

## 2026.03.03-1

### Extensions

- Updated `worktree` — added `/wt rebase` command (rebases current worktree branch onto local `main` with `--autostash`, detects and reports conflicts); added shell-escaping for template variables in sync command; clarified template variable availability (`parentDir` only supports `{{main}}` and `{{project}}`).
- Updated `review` — head commit selector now filters to commits strictly newer than the selected base; fixed scoped package path stripping (e.g. `@scope/pkg` preserved, only pi file-mention `@`-paths are stripped); custom review type no longer requires a git repo.
- Updated `commit` — removed spurious "Thinking…" progress phase on `turn_start` events.

### Skills

- Added `doc-system` — product documentation system design and maintenance principles: on-demand loading, single source of truth, open-closed structure, mockup screen index management.
- Added `sdd` — Spec-Driven Development: structured feature planning through Requirements → Design → Tasks → Verification, with approval gates between phases.
- Removed `bdd` skill.

### Prompts

- Added `/brainstorming` — turns ideas into fully formed designs through Diverge → Converge → Reflect dialogue; hard-gates implementation until design is approved.
- Added `/dev-loop` — automated development loop: claim todo, branch, develop, code review, merge, repeat.
- Updated `/tech-stack-decision` — translated from Chinese to English; now language-agnostic.

### Config

- Updated `AGENTS.md` — strengthened commit-as-you-go rule (staged diff >~150 lines or 3+ uncommitted logical changes = violation); added rule to read `doc-system` skill before creating or moving any file under `docs/`.
- Updated `shared/scripts/docs-list.ts` — improved front-matter validation and listing logic.
- Added `shared/bin/docs-list` — compiled binary wrapper for the docs-list script.

## 2026.02.26-1

### Extensions

- Updated `commit` — real-time progress notifications via JSON event stream (reading diff, staging, committing…); added 2-minute hard timeout with SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation; added `--no-skills` and `--no-prompt-templates` flags to subprocess.
- Updated `review` — bumped commit history limit to 100 in commit and range selectors; fixed `@`-prefix stripping to handle all file-mention tokens correctly.

### Shared

- Added `nanobanana` script — image editing via Gemini's image generation API; pass an image path and a text prompt, get an edited image back.

### Docs

- Updated `docs/tools.md` — added `nanobanana` tool reference.

## 2026.02.25-1

### Extensions

- Updated `review` — added commit range review (`/review range <base> <head>`); interactive two-step selector for picking base and head commits.

## 2026.02.24-1

### Extensions

- Rewrote `commit` — now spawns an isolated `pi` subprocess with Haiku instead of branching/model-switching; removed `/end-commit` command.
- Updated `review` — git-dependent presets are hidden when not in a git repo; smart default falls back to "folder" outside git repos; switched review model to `gpt-5.3-codex`.
- Converted `mpd` from multi-file extension (directory) to single-file extension.
- Removed `notify` extension.
- Updated `todo` — formatting cleanup and minor prompt tweaks.

### Skills

## 2026.02.21-1

## 2026.02.20-1

### Extensions

- Added `commit` — `/commit` and `/end-commit` commands; auto-branches to a cheap model (Haiku/Flash) when running on an expensive model to save tokens.
- Added `mpd` — `/mpd` Merge-Push-Delete: merges current feature branch into default, pushes, and deletes local branch in one shot.
- Updated `review` — added file/path review (aliases: `file`, `path`); quote-aware path parsing (single/double quotes, backslash escapes); tilde expansion; works outside git repos.

### Skills

- Added `google-sheets` — Google Sheets API via curl; reads, writes, appends, and batch-updates spreadsheet data without an SDK.
- Updated `ralph-wiggum` — refined trigger criteria: start with direct execution by default; escalate to Ralph only after 2+ failed hypotheses or repeated blockers.
